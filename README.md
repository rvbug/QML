# Inspiration

My inspiration to work on Quantum Gravity is drawn from 2014 film [Interstellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)) directed by [Christopher Nolan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan). The movie is scientifically accuracte. The black hole shown in the movie uses actual calculations which took more than 100+ hours to render.

Noble Price winer and a theoretical physicist [Kip Thorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip_Thorne), was the scientific consultant for this movie. He is a long time friend and colleague Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan. 


This [Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Interstellar) explains movie's technical details.
